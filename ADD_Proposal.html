    <h2>ADD (Ally, Dreamer, Doer)</h2>
    <h3>Key Topic, Expressions and Intent:::</h3>
    <p> I’ve come up short every time; trying to explore multiple ways in which to create a networked space for people to come together and foster a community. Turns out the fixation on a purpose and public appeal clogged my understanding from what
      was most important. I have forgotten what a network meant and how interaction thrives. Up until now, most of my digital projects are mostly directed towards one person at a time. A networked space is a community, a collaboration. This is
      meaningful because I truly believe no one can be creative unless they are surrounded by a simulated environment and creative people. Also, much like moving to a new city, if not at a subconscious level, we try to assimilate into a community. So
      more and more, we often turn to the web for sources of information and inspiration. Perhaps because our priorities have shifted due to the new affordances necessary to stand in our society. Also, opinions, not ideas, have easily devalued and
      split up numerous online communities. I won’t discount the fact that all communities with the best intentions of inclusivity will ultimately be biased and self-segregate. However, ideas in the name of art have a way to bring together the most
      clashing of personalities. (I won’t apologize for bringing in a cliche.) So since most of the time we cannot or don’t want to be physically present, “ADD” could be a fun virtual space to cultivate one’s sense of self and connect to others
      through creativity.</p>

    <p>Nothing will take effect unless I am able to capture the user first. Therefore I will need to demonstrate a perception of vastness where the viewer has no boundaries. The manner of interaction can be very elegant. I am reflecting on how one
      interaction can impact others and how I can contribute. I understand that good interaction has many facets. A little bit of competition, commonality, diversity, mutual cooperation, and accountability goes a long way. I want to give the user the
      opportunity to choose between being an ‘ally’, a ‘dreamer’, and ‘doer’ within this virtual community. Sometimes seemingly non-interaction can be an inlet for future relationships. Meaning I want to support those who do not want to engage with
      others and just want to explore the space. However, everyone is free to choose between all identities because choices are a privilege and a good first impression. I will also use an elementary approach of play to destabilize the user. Play is a
      process of stimulation such as curiosity, frustration, happiness, sadness, empowerment, procrastination and even distraction. These feelings and motions can be to some extent, guidance for navigating the virtual space. There is never pressure
      for motivation, or a fixed agenda when inspiration comes. Surely a few people will want to contribute an idea, make a project or just be present. All it takes is a tiny sensation of belonging and the user would naturally measure themselves with
      the environment and people around them.</p>

    <p>First and foremost, I’m hoping to encourage users to get lost in my web page. Meaning they would be able to be immersed by all the foolish activities on the site. There would be a simple driver game where the user can achieve trivial feats
      that reveal a concept or input that anyone has submitted. Meanwhile, they also have the option to make an input. Perhaps add to a concept or add a response to a concept in forms of any audio or visual representation. If the user decides to just
      explore, they should be oblivious to the time spent on the space. If the space is engaged with success, then an awareness of potential collaboration and reward of participation could be established. I’m not certain I can empower anyone, but I
      believe the right environment can promote it. The act of play relieves the user of the demand to perform. Play harkens back to an innocence that is fundamental to learning about our surroundings. There can be lots of silliness between users if
      they do decide to collaborate. I am apprehensive to what a failed or unpopular input may be, since there would be no official regulations. I am going to depend on the space’s impression and interaction structure to discourage negative
      behaviors. This web space should impart a childlike acceptance from my users, along with a recognition of the self that could be a form of personal reflection.

    <h2>research projects:::</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.wefeelfine.org">We Feel Fine</a> by Johathan Harris & Sep Kamvar (2006)
    </h3>
    <p> We Feel Fine is a visual representation of human emotional data collected from blog entries. The authors were able to develop a system that is able to sift through blogs everyday. It first identifies phrases such as “I feel” or “I am feeling”
      and analyzes them. The system is able to interpret with the phrases the emotions it applies to (ex. Happy, sad, anxious, depressed, etc.). Simultaneously, the database collects all other relational information that could be associated with any
      input. Their system takes advantage of the basic information structure of a blog. A blog may disclose a person’s age, their gender, and where they are located. Then using that moment and location in time, secondary data is recorded of the
      blog’s current physical, social and cultural environment. With all this data, each feeling is organized and broken down to six ‘formal movements’: Madness, Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics, and Mounds. Madness is an image of particles, each
      embodying different emotions and enclosed, the phrase that conveys it. Murmurs gives the user a sense of nonstop feelings that are coming through. Montage are instead photos that connect to the individual emotions. Mobs show a bar chart that
      separates each feeling into an age group. Metrics tie together what certain weather is present when people are depressed. Mounds display on a map the location of where people are posting their feelings. We Feel Fine is a data-centric exhibit of
      human emotions at a world-wide scale. Ideally, the database grows everyday with new entries that reflect how everyone experiences their lives and the changes within it. </p>


    <h3><a href="https://www.newgestures.com/">The Archive of New Gestures</a> by Merlin Heintzman Hope (2020)</h3>
    <p> The Archive of New Gestures was introduced to record the many mentalities that have emerged from living under the pandemic. The site aims to gather stories, actions, and simple gestures. The objective is to establish connections through
      collective storytelling. On the main page, users are allowed to ‘add a gesture’ or ‘interpret a gesture’. Below the options are a list of entries starting from the most recent. Each gesture is categorized under seven labels: Adaptation, Hope,
      Denial, Loneliness, Boredom, I don’t know, and Other (all color coded). Some of the labels include a small quote. Adaptation: “It's not a pandemic, It’s an opportunity”. Hope: “This will only bring us closer together”. Denial: “And that’s how
      they get us!”. Loneliness: “ I haven’t been touched in a year”. Boredom: “The birthplace of the best and worst part of creativity”. The user can explore the archive itself, contribute or collaborate. The author suggests that any contribution
      can be anything from critical to banal. There are gestures of how users interact with public spaces, themselves and others. How feelings are expressed through verse, drawings, photos, videos and performances. When users want to offer an
      interpretation of a gesture, they are asked to document their experience by a drawing or an act, all compiled with the same gesture. Gestures have long been used in performance to be a display of presence, or experience. This storytelling
      platform is an avenue to document daily life and allow users to contribute to other’s experiences of similar feelings.

    <h3><a href="https://bruno-simon.com/">Bruno Simon</a> by Bruno Simon</h3>
    <p> Bruno Simon is a portfolio website developed to engage the user to not only take interest in his portfolio but be engaged by game play. Upon entering the site, the user is shown simple arrow movement instructions that allow the user to
      navigate a 3d car game. The car is able to explore an open 3d world with a camera perspective that originates with the car. The main content is contained within partial block walls to communicate boundaries and pathways are indicated through
      simple tiles. Road signs point to different parts where the user can view his projects, resume, a playground and links to his contact information. Each section is a part of a universe and objects like statues, trees, ramps, panels, walls, etc.
      are all objects the car can either bump into or run over. It has an overall simple clean design. The colors are vibrant but flat (matt) with neat rounded profiles. While the user moves around the environment, each object is updated with a
      rotation, position, and shadow orientation. As a result, Simon created an open game that users will spend a lot of time playing.

    <h2>Research Project compare/contrast:::</h2>
    <p> I intend to develop a collective space where users will collaborate through the act of play. Each project chosen for my research has an element of what I wish to implement. We Feel Fine demonstrates attractive data presentations. The
      structure of gathering collective gestures in The Archives of Gestures is a great reference of how my website could function as a collective network. Finally, I hope to capture the user’s attention by setting up a similar game that Bruno Simon
      provides as his portfolio. I find We Feel Fine a very data driven website where human feelings are ‘mined’, even though their data is taken from public blogs, it lacks a sincerity I want for my project. The Archives of Gestures was originally
      created for all but it seems that mostly “artists” are engaging with it. And Bruno Simon’s website is really used to market his creativity and brand. I hope I will be able to use elements from all the research projects to develop a fun, more
      inclusive collective network for my users.</p>
